    <h2>YOU SPEAK WITH YOUR GOD <br> THE FLYING SPAGUETTI MONSTER</h2>
    <p class="one">O´ Divine one <br>
        As has been proclaimed by the Pirates, Ahoy! for a New Age has come. 
        Let the printed idols fall before the Awesome might of the Noodle! 
        Let there be singing in the streets and countrysides of the great divinity that is The Flying Spaghetti Monster. 
        Let the Saviors of the past degenerate into the myths they are. 
        Let Boyardee be raised up and with a mighty “Arrr” let the Holy Land be found. 
        And once there, let a great monument to the Midget, the Mountain, and the Tree be built and consecrated 
        in the name of the image of the Skull and Crossbones. <br>The Swords are drawn. 
        The flags are waving. And the ships are coming to assault the port of Untruth! 
        Pillaging, plundering, and wenching will commence, and when that is done, 
        a great cloud of saucey awesomeness will billow in the image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster,
         the highest and most powerful Noodle! <br>
        
        R'amen.</p>
